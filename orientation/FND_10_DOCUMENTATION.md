# Documenting Ruby

Through this course, you will be documenting all of your code. In Ruby, you will be using RDoc to accomplish this.

You are strongly encourage to read the [RDoc Documentation](http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/)  for guidance on the standard conventions that the Ruby developer community uses for documentation.

We will be following the guideline below, and the instruction staff will be making sure that you conform to it.
