# Charmed Polygons

A charmed polygon is a sqaure with a side length of X and contains all the numbers between 1 and X^squared aligned so that each column row and long diagonal of numbers when added together equals the same number. To get X, the program should accept input from the terminal. X should equal an odd number, if the given input is not an odd whole number the program should ask for input again. 
The method should return the square to the terminal:
